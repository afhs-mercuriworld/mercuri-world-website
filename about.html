    <!-- Mercuri's Story -->
    <section class="bg-white/5 p-6 rounded-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="text-[#b4c4f8]">
        mercuri.world began as an idea within the Hack Foundation, a nonprofit created by students and alumni from institutions such as Harvard and MIT. What started as a small initiative quickly grew into a global community once its founders recognized how deeply students needed accessible, science-backed mental health education. From the beginning, mercuri.world has been shaped by the belief that young people can lead meaningful change when given the tools, knowledge, and opportunities to do so. Over time, the club expanded into a structured international program with dedicated committees, leadership roles, research efforts, educational events, and digital innovation projects. Today, mercuri.world continues to evolve through the passion of its members — students who are committed to improving mental health support in their schools, communities, and beyond. The organization remains grounded in its original vision: to empower students everywhere to learn, create, and advocate for a healthier future.
