            Hello everyone! My name is Misha and I am so excited to be the co-president of Mercuri World. This club means a lot to me, and I founded it with my co-founder Ananya so that I could make an international impact on the mental health community. I am confident that our club will build a team of hard workers dedicated to projects that will transform mental health within our school and beyond. Together, let's spread mental health and create positive environments everywhere!

            Hi! I'm Ananya Prassanna, a freshman at AFHS. Over the summer, I joined Mercuri World, a global organization dedicated to raising awareness about mental health through digital resources and meaningful solutions. Inspired by the impact it was making, I helped start the Mercuri World AFHS chapter, where I now serve as president and co-founder. I'm passionate about empowering students to get involved, spark conversations, and help close the gaps in teen mental health. I'm excited to grow our chapter and hope many of you will join us in creating meaningful, positive change at our school!

            Hi, my name is Yoshitha (or Yoshii)! I'm the Volunteer Committee Head of the Mercuri World chapter at Apex Friendship High School. I joined this club because I believe mental health is a topic that deserves to be openly discussed. Mental health is just as important as physical health and can have a huge impact on someone's life. Through Mercuri World, I get the opportunity to raise awareness, support others, and make a positive difference in our community. Being part of this club allows me to help plan events, organize volunteer projects, and create safe spaces where people can talk about mental wellness.
